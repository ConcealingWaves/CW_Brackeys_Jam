# Starfunk Fever

In the year 4014, mankind has forgotten how to groove. No music reaches the ears of the common man, and life is a total bummer. But in the furthest outer reaches of the galaxy, Dr. Funk E has created the baddest creature in human history. The living party parasite, Disco-7. Flying through the void of space, Disco-7 delivers good vibes to the people in need, whether they want it or not.
